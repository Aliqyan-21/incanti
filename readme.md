**Incanti** – A single-header C++ library for simple and elegant command line argument parsing.

</div>

Just as a sorcerer meticulously prepares incantations to manifest a spell, **Incanti** helps you structure the commands that bring your software to life.
It transforms the chaotic ritual of `argc` and `argv` into a clean, expressive declaration of intent.

Simply drop in `incanti.hpp`, define your options, and let Incanti handle the rest without any external dependencies.

## Status

**Work in progress!** ## Usage (coming soon)

```cpp
#include "incanti.hpp"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    // Your incantations here...
}
